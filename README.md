# kata-minesweeper

The goal here is to implement a typescript implementation of the [Minesweeper game](https://birrell.org/andrew/minesweeper/)

## Goal

## Prerequisites

You need typescript and tsd installed:

    npm install typescript -g
    npm install tsd -g

## Running the example

    npm i
    gulp

Gulp will start watching changes to your code and execute the unit tests automatically.

Enjoy.
